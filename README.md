# 3D-IC-Arrangement
Arrangement of IC in 3 Dimensions

In this era, as the number of Integrated Circuits increases,there is demand to reduce the space occupied by it. Till now we are using the IC in 2-D version but what if we can increase a dimensions in which we can use the storing the IC. That why introduction to three dimensional IC was made: A layer of IC stacked on top of one another.

But as the IC are stacked together, there are problem as to how the IC at different layer will connect to one another. That's where the TSV (Through Silicon Via) comes into play. These TSV help to connect the layer to one layer to every other layer. But these are very expensive and hence their used has to be limited as much possible.

Another problem with IC are the heat generated by it. And stacking IC randomly together will only lead to more heating problem. Hence the arrangement should be done in such a way the IC generating more power should be nearer to the cooling System.

The final problem is to reduce the difference of area between any 2 layers. As the IC are first arranged in plane for a Layer, they have certain area. As we increase number the layer, the area will differ for different layer. And the aim is to reduce the difference, so as maximize the use of 3D space.
